./ljs/wavs/0.wav|the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. 
./ljs/wavs/1.wav|along with all the other reference that i had 
./ljs/wavs/2.wav|i wouldn't have hesitated for a second. 
./ljs/wavs/3.wav|i would always examine the patient. 
./ljs/wavs/4.wav|well we like to play with stuff. 
./ljs/wavs/5.wav|to make a good living. 
./ljs/wavs/6.wav|this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north. 
./ljs/wavs/7.wav|we are going to be the next generation 
./ljs/wavs/8.wav|buildings are becoming bundles of services. 
./ljs/wavs/9.wav|and that's what happened at the end of that three month period. 
./ljs/wavs/10.wav|which is right next to the sun. 
./ljs/wavs/11.wav|talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. 
./ljs/wavs/12.wav|i just want to turn to a few of them. 
./ljs/wavs/13.wav|if you want to become more compassionate 
./ljs/wavs/14.wav|so it's not about devaluing 
./ljs/wavs/15.wav|whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. 
./ljs/wavs/16.wav|and they do some tests and figure out that 
./ljs/wavs/17.wav|that's pretty amazing. 
./ljs/wavs/18.wav|these are led lights that help the roughly billion people out there 
./ljs/wavs/19.wav|i've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation 
./ljs/wavs/20.wav|your position in life comes to seem not accidental 
./ljs/wavs/21.wav|or to put it slightly differently 
./ljs/wavs/22.wav|particularly when we have people thinking in groups. 
./ljs/wavs/23.wav|but we also get to see the whole thing. 
./ljs/wavs/24.wav|it doesn't matter if i'm actually good at it. 
./ljs/wavs/25.wav|but i'm sure najmuddin and his friends 
./ljs/wavs/26.wav|and i would do it again. 
./ljs/wavs/27.wav|three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the u.s. 
./ljs/wavs/28.wav|so that's what lauren did. 
./ljs/wavs/29.wav|as history points out 
./ljs/wavs/30.wav|and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. 
./ljs/wavs/31.wav|as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. 
./ljs/wavs/32.wav|then we couldn't use it in the video. 
./ljs/wavs/33.wav|and that lesson will stick with them. 
./ljs/wavs/34.wav|they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling. 
./ljs/wavs/35.wav|who were also interested in exploring that conversation. 
./ljs/wavs/36.wav|what we need is information. 
./ljs/wavs/37.wav|and if you open the newspaper any day of the week 
./ljs/wavs/38.wav|you can imagine what something like this might look like five 
./ljs/wavs/39.wav|look at religion and do the communal bit. 
./ljs/wavs/40.wav|kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. 
./ljs/wavs/41.wav|which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them. 
./ljs/wavs/42.wav|and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel. 
./ljs/wavs/43.wav|so, you thought you could really get away with this? 
./ljs/wavs/44.wav|he actually did lose wax casting in bronze for me 
./ljs/wavs/45.wav|when we think about failure, 
./ljs/wavs/46.wav|he's full of problems 
./ljs/wavs/47.wav|when you get dementia, 
./ljs/wavs/48.wav|expecting to find a revision worth noting. 
./ljs/wavs/49.wav|i didn't know where my corners were 
./ljs/wavs/50.wav|you've got to come up and see them. 
./ljs/wavs/51.wav|that's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper. 
./ljs/wavs/52.wav|if you dyed your hair black, 
./ljs/wavs/53.wav|but the over eating and over drinking 
./ljs/wavs/54.wav|snobbery is a global phenomenon. 
./ljs/wavs/55.wav|they're bashing up against each other. 
./ljs/wavs/56.wav|this area shown here, is an area called the hippocampus. 
./ljs/wavs/57.wav|so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. 
./ljs/wavs/58.wav|they will leave the elementary schools saying 
./ljs/wavs/59.wav|and this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. 
./ljs/wavs/60.wav|i don't need to go into that. 
./ljs/wavs/61.wav|so if we zoom in to an even deeper level 
./ljs/wavs/62.wav|it was like something out of caligula. 
./ljs/wavs/63.wav|if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. 
./ljs/wavs/64.wav|it's one continuous processing unit 
./ljs/wavs/65.wav|and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing. 
./ljs/wavs/66.wav|what did you do with the other child? 
./ljs/wavs/67.wav|many of those patients, are very severely burned. 
./ljs/wavs/68.wav|but on the content of their character 
./ljs/wavs/69.wav|and wasichu is a lakota word that means non indian 
./ljs/wavs/70.wav|they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. 
./ljs/wavs/71.wav|domestic violence and general apathy 
./ljs/wavs/72.wav|that's not quite right, is it? 
./ljs/wavs/73.wav|they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier 
./ljs/wavs/74.wav|looking for a low cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. 
./ljs/wavs/75.wav|we knew that it was political. 
./ljs/wavs/76.wav|and what we're finding is actually 
./ljs/wavs/77.wav|but there's actually a lot of structure there. 
./ljs/wavs/78.wav|wealthy country in the world. 
./ljs/wavs/79.wav|we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet. 
./ljs/wavs/80.wav|and that gave women the right to vote. 
./ljs/wavs/81.wav|i come out of the advertising and design business. 
./ljs/wavs/82.wav|that, is an unknown part of them. 
./ljs/wavs/83.wav|the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
./ljs/wavs/84.wav|her son donated all of his toys to her 
./ljs/wavs/85.wav|the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
./ljs/wavs/86.wav|her son donated all of his toys to her 
./ljs/wavs/87.wav|with all these sandbags at the windows. 
./ljs/wavs/88.wav|anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. 
./ljs/wavs/89.wav|well, what do you want to write 
./ljs/wavs/90.wav|so here we have this triangle 
./ljs/wavs/91.wav|i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital 
./ljs/wavs/92.wav|nor is it the most intelligent that survives 
./ljs/wavs/93.wav|it's not all perfect yet. 
./ljs/wavs/94.wav|if the horse was in pain, 
./ljs/wavs/95.wav|all the mothers that give life 
./ljs/wavs/96.wav|put into the atmosphere 
./ljs/wavs/97.wav|and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. 
./ljs/wavs/98.wav|it is the one that is most adaptable to change. 
./ljs/wavs/99.wav|or might have looked like
