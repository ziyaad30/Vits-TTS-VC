./ljs/wavs/0.wav|the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. 
./ljs/wavs/1.wav|along with all the other reference that i had 
./ljs/wavs/2.wav|i wouldn't have hesitated for a second. 
./ljs/wavs/3.wav|i would always examine the patient. 
./ljs/wavs/4.wav|well we like to play with stuff. 
./ljs/wavs/5.wav|to make a good living. 
./ljs/wavs/6.wav|this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north. 
./ljs/wavs/7.wav|we are going to be the next generation 
./ljs/wavs/8.wav|buildings are becoming bundles of services. 
./ljs/wavs/9.wav|and that's what happened at the end of that three month period. 
./ljs/wavs/10.wav|which is right next to the sun. 
./ljs/wavs/11.wav|talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. 
./ljs/wavs/12.wav|i just want to turn to a few of them. 
./ljs/wavs/13.wav|if you want to become more compassionate 
./ljs/wavs/14.wav|so it's not about devaluing 
./ljs/wavs/15.wav|whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. 
./ljs/wavs/16.wav|and they do some tests and figure out that 
./ljs/wavs/17.wav|that's pretty amazing. 
./ljs/wavs/18.wav|these are led lights that help the roughly billion people out there 
./ljs/wavs/19.wav|i've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation 
./ljs/wavs/20.wav|your position in life comes to seem not accidental 
./ljs/wavs/21.wav|or to put it slightly differently 
./ljs/wavs/22.wav|particularly when we have people thinking in groups. 
./ljs/wavs/23.wav|but we also get to see the whole thing. 
./ljs/wavs/24.wav|it doesn't matter if i'm actually good at it. 
./ljs/wavs/25.wav|but i'm sure najmuddin and his friends 
./ljs/wavs/26.wav|and i would do it again. 
./ljs/wavs/27.wav|three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the u.s. 
./ljs/wavs/28.wav|so that's what lauren did. 
./ljs/wavs/29.wav|as history points out 
./ljs/wavs/30.wav|and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. 
./ljs/wavs/31.wav|as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. 
./ljs/wavs/32.wav|then we couldn't use it in the video. 
./ljs/wavs/33.wav|and that lesson will stick with them. 
./ljs/wavs/34.wav|they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling. 
./ljs/wavs/35.wav|who were also interested in exploring that conversation. 
./ljs/wavs/36.wav|what we need is information. 
./ljs/wavs/37.wav|and if you open the newspaper any day of the week 
./ljs/wavs/38.wav|you can imagine what something like this might look like five 
./ljs/wavs/39.wav|look at religion and do the communal bit. 
./ljs/wavs/40.wav|kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. 
./ljs/wavs/41.wav|which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them. 
./ljs/wavs/42.wav|and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel. 
./ljs/wavs/43.wav|so, you thought you could really get away with this? 
./ljs/wavs/44.wav|he actually did lose wax casting in bronze for me 
./ljs/wavs/45.wav|when we think about failure, 
./ljs/wavs/46.wav|he's full of problems 
./ljs/wavs/47.wav|when you get dementia, 
./ljs/wavs/48.wav|expecting to find a revision worth noting. 
./ljs/wavs/49.wav|i didn't know where my corners were 
./ljs/wavs/50.wav|you've got to come up and see them. 
./ljs/wavs/51.wav|that's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper. 
./ljs/wavs/52.wav|if you dyed your hair black, 
./ljs/wavs/53.wav|but the over eating and over drinking 
./ljs/wavs/54.wav|snobbery is a global phenomenon. 
./ljs/wavs/55.wav|they're bashing up against each other. 
./ljs/wavs/56.wav|this area shown here, is an area called the hippocampus. 
./ljs/wavs/57.wav|so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. 
./ljs/wavs/58.wav|they will leave the elementary schools saying 
./ljs/wavs/59.wav|and this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. 
./ljs/wavs/60.wav|i don't need to go into that. 
./ljs/wavs/61.wav|so if we zoom in to an even deeper level 
./ljs/wavs/62.wav|it was like something out of caligula. 
./ljs/wavs/63.wav|if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. 
./ljs/wavs/64.wav|it's one continuous processing unit 
./ljs/wavs/65.wav|and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing. 
./ljs/wavs/66.wav|what did you do with the other child? 
./ljs/wavs/67.wav|many of those patients, are very severely burned. 
./ljs/wavs/68.wav|but on the content of their character 
./ljs/wavs/69.wav|and wasichu is a lakota word that means non indian 
./ljs/wavs/70.wav|they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. 
./ljs/wavs/71.wav|domestic violence and general apathy 
./ljs/wavs/72.wav|that's not quite right, is it? 
./ljs/wavs/73.wav|they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier 
./ljs/wavs/74.wav|looking for a low cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. 
./ljs/wavs/75.wav|we knew that it was political. 
./ljs/wavs/76.wav|and what we're finding is actually 
./ljs/wavs/77.wav|but there's actually a lot of structure there. 
./ljs/wavs/78.wav|wealthy country in the world. 
./ljs/wavs/79.wav|we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet. 
./ljs/wavs/80.wav|and that gave women the right to vote. 
./ljs/wavs/81.wav|i come out of the advertising and design business. 
./ljs/wavs/82.wav|that, is an unknown part of them. 
./ljs/wavs/83.wav|the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
./ljs/wavs/84.wav|her son donated all of his toys to her 
./ljs/wavs/85.wav|the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
./ljs/wavs/86.wav|her son donated all of his toys to her 
./ljs/wavs/87.wav|with all these sandbags at the windows. 
./ljs/wavs/88.wav|anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. 
./ljs/wavs/89.wav|well, what do you want to write 
./ljs/wavs/90.wav|so here we have this triangle 
./ljs/wavs/91.wav|i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital 
./ljs/wavs/92.wav|nor is it the most intelligent that survives 
./ljs/wavs/93.wav|it's not all perfect yet. 
./ljs/wavs/94.wav|if the horse was in pain, 
./ljs/wavs/95.wav|all the mothers that give life 
./ljs/wavs/96.wav|put into the atmosphere 
./ljs/wavs/97.wav|and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. 
./ljs/wavs/98.wav|it is the one that is most adaptable to change. 
./ljs/wavs/99.wav|or might have looked like 
./ljs/wavs/100.wav|you can see this is a major shipping airport 
./ljs/wavs/101.wav|so i guess i'd better go play video games or get into sports 
./ljs/wavs/102.wav|you encounter it within minutes at a party 
./ljs/wavs/103.wav|or i've got to do sports. 
./ljs/wavs/104.wav|then you know that pine ridge is ground zero for native issues in the u.s. 
./ljs/wavs/105.wav|and if we're going to really 
./ljs/wavs/106.wav|if you happen to be poor 
./ljs/wavs/107.wav|the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created 
./ljs/wavs/108.wav|and that is all you have to do. 
./ljs/wavs/109.wav|so we have to have a change in consciousness. 
./ljs/wavs/110.wav|which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin 
./ljs/wavs/111.wav|you don't want to watch. 
./ljs/wavs/112.wav|organized the document 
./ljs/wavs/113.wav|look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific 
./ljs/wavs/114.wav|an argentine composer. 
./ljs/wavs/115.wav|and then what we get is our first mapping. 
./ljs/wavs/116.wav|so there's nothing feminine about feminism. 
./ljs/wavs/117.wav|we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can 
./ljs/wavs/118.wav|the machine acting upon the band members 
./ljs/wavs/119.wav|but it's always with me. 
./ljs/wavs/120.wav|i would like to ask you to re frame that. 
./ljs/wavs/121.wav|have you seen the ads? 
./ljs/wavs/122.wav|and mahmoud was coming every day. 
./ljs/wavs/123.wav|and we'll call this a wheel. 
./ljs/wavs/124.wav|so what i'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. 
./ljs/wavs/125.wav|we weren't our american selves, 
./ljs/wavs/126.wav|you have to be generous 
./ljs/wavs/127.wav|they make their livings on this kind of stuff. 
./ljs/wavs/128.wav|i was worried, because i was breaking the rules. 
./ljs/wavs/129.wav|there are words that we just don't want to hear. 
./ljs/wavs/130.wav|and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. 
./ljs/wavs/131.wav|then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? 
./ljs/wavs/132.wav|this is that great big secret. 
./ljs/wavs/133.wav|now what i learned from her, 
./ljs/wavs/134.wav|and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. 
./ljs/wavs/135.wav|mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans. 
./ljs/wavs/136.wav|it costs about the same to produce a new drug 
./ljs/wavs/137.wav|and the cycle continues 
./ljs/wavs/138.wav|why does that sense of mystery? 
./ljs/wavs/139.wav|and they're always talking about this stuff. 
./ljs/wavs/140.wav|i spent a lot of time at airport security. 
./ljs/wavs/141.wav|and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school 
./ljs/wavs/142.wav|which happens right here. 
./ljs/wavs/143.wav|i was able to stone one adulterer. 
./ljs/wavs/144.wav|and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. 
./ljs/wavs/145.wav|and prevent the onset of the disease, to a bad state. 
./ljs/wavs/146.wav|and i think every human 
./ljs/wavs/147.wav|it's how we identify fellow canadians. 
./ljs/wavs/148.wav|sex with mum was blinding in a way 
./ljs/wavs/149.wav|and a record executive walked up to me and invited me to nashville 
./ljs/wavs/150.wav|gaetano badalamenti was born on september fourteenth, nineteen twenty-three in palermo, a rural town near the coast west of palermo. 
./ljs/wavs/151.wav|in october nineteen fifty-seven, lucky luciano had arranged, sicilian and american mafia leaders to meet at palermo's grande albergo 
./ljs/wavs/152.wav|james riddle hoffa, commonly known as jimmy hoffa, was a fast rising union organizer for the international brotherhood of teamsters union. 
./ljs/wavs/153.wav|angelo met john gotti when the gotti's moved to east new york from sheepshead bay, at the time they were both twelve year olds. 
./ljs/wavs/154.wav|in nineteen seventy, the sicilian mafia commission was revived and consisted of ten members, but would initially be ruled by a triumvirate 
./ljs/wavs/155.wav|together with his younger brothers rosario and giuseppe, john formed a faction of the gambino crime family, 
./ljs/wavs/156.wav|angelo bruno, an enigmatic figure whose life's narrative unfolded on the gritty streets of philadelphia, 
./ljs/wavs/157.wav|rosario spatola, second in command under the late salvatore inzerillo, and co sponsor of michele sindona's fake kidnapping, 
./ljs/wavs/158.wav|russell bufalino was born rosario alfredo bufalino on september twenty-ninth, nineteen oh three, in montedoro, sicily, to angelo bufalino and cristina buccoleri. 
./ljs/wavs/159.wav|vito genovese wanted to legitimize his new power by holding a national cosa nostra meeting. 
./ljs/wavs/160.wav|he called on buffalo, new york boss and commission member, stefano magaddino... who in turn chose northeastern pennsylvania crime boss, 
./ljs/wavs/161.wav|but if we're serious people, 
./ljs/wavs/162.wav|and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes. 
./ljs/wavs/163.wav|i guess this really isn't a place for boys. 
./ljs/wavs/164.wav|but because the whole visit was now about the physical 
./ljs/wavs/165.wav|we should not fear other countries becoming wealthy. 
./ljs/wavs/166.wav|but most people haven't. 
./ljs/wavs/167.wav|you can't pick individual sheep 
./ljs/wavs/168.wav|my own theory of success 
./ljs/wavs/169.wav|i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can. 
./ljs/wavs/170.wav|it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist 
./ljs/wavs/171.wav|but this isn't even about reddit itself. 
./ljs/wavs/172.wav|but at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us 
./ljs/wavs/173.wav|was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail. 
./ljs/wavs/174.wav|and would you want to meet that poor 
./ljs/wavs/175.wav|we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy. 
./ljs/wavs/176.wav|and can we afford not to 
./ljs/wavs/177.wav|we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. 
./ljs/wavs/178.wav|then you can start finding ways to see things. 
./ljs/wavs/179.wav|maybe it's too simple. 
./ljs/wavs/180.wav|there are simply too many random factors. 
./ljs/wavs/181.wav|and we did exactly that. 
./ljs/wavs/182.wav|and i think that we will. 
./ljs/wavs/183.wav|and they're in violent motion. 
./ljs/wavs/184.wav|now we may find that there are places that are really 
./ljs/wavs/185.wav|no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair. 
./ljs/wavs/186.wav|that thou shall have reverence. 
./ljs/wavs/187.wav|the japanese government called off their whaling expedition. 
./ljs/wavs/188.wav|not just that, religion is wrong 
./ljs/wavs/189.wav|we need to do it for our own economy. 
./ljs/wavs/190.wav|now the word propaganda sets off alarm bells. 
./ljs/wavs/191.wav|i really like turning the pages of the old testament. 
./ljs/wavs/192.wav|i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. 
./ljs/wavs/193.wav|so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. 
./ljs/wavs/194.wav|most people are not our mothers. 
./ljs/wavs/195.wav|transit systems that actually work to transport people 
./ljs/wavs/196.wav|dignity cannot wait for better times. 
./ljs/wavs/197.wav|which potential do we want to bring out 
./ljs/wavs/198.wav|people are either incredibly delighted to see you 
./ljs/wavs/199.wav|if you talk to faculty 
./ljs/wavs/200.wav|more particularly as regards locomotion. 
./ljs/wavs/201.wav|misess paine brought oswald's family to new orleans. 
./ljs/wavs/202.wav|once, during the long illness of george the third, as many as one hundred were there waiting the "report," as it was called. 
./ljs/wavs/203.wav|these informal and part time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of president mckinley; 
./ljs/wavs/204.wav|in deciding whether lee harvey oswald fired the shots which killed president kennedy and wounded governor connally, 
./ljs/wavs/205.wav|the second mate, who had heard the hammering of the capstan bars and the handspikes, with the first mate's and captain's agonized cries, had come out, 
./ljs/wavs/206.wav|in which one man single handedly created publicity for his cause or for himself. 
./ljs/wavs/207.wav|that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities. 
./ljs/wavs/208.wav|the debtors were crowded almost inconceivably. in a space twenty feet long by six wide, 
./ljs/wavs/209.wav|had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards, was the only person present at the distribution of beer, and was trusted to examine, 
./ljs/wavs/210.wav|heinz w. michaelis, office manager of both george rose and company, incorporated and seaport traders, incorporated. 
./ljs/wavs/211.wav|would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period. 
./ljs/wavs/212.wav|when the congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to improve the conditions of labor, 
./ljs/wavs/213.wav|at approximately one:fifteen p.m., tippit, who was cruising east on tenth street, 
./ljs/wavs/214.wav|parish officers, peace officers, the high constable of the county of middlesex on horseback, and then the body of williams, 
./ljs/wavs/215.wav|the interior of one prison was illuminated throughout with gas, still a novelty, which had been generally adopted in london only four years previously, 
./ljs/wavs/216.wav|even in italy most of the theological and law books were printed in gothic letter, 
./ljs/wavs/217.wav|by the evening of november twenty two, five of them had identified lee harvey oswald in police lineups, as the man they saw. 
./ljs/wavs/218.wav|he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence, hoping to find an open sky light by which he might enter, and so work downstairs. 
./ljs/wavs/219.wav|under holding company domination the utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself, and with public sentiment. 
./ljs/wavs/220.wav|the outside public continued to be excluded from the newgate chapel, on the day the condemned sermon was preached. 
./ljs/wavs/221.wav|beginning on september thirteen, when the times herald announced in a front page article that president kennedy was planning a brief one day tour of four texas cities 
./ljs/wavs/222.wav|this must in the first instance, be provided for them by green plants, and hence without chlorophyll bearing plants, 
./ljs/wavs/223.wav|the officers ensconced themselves in the latter, and waited for buncher's expected visit. 
./ljs/wavs/224.wav|what this bill means to punish, is the crime of interruption of the government of the united states and the destruction of its security, by striking down the life 
./ljs/wavs/225.wav|that for long, no idea of interfering with them was entertained. 
./ljs/wavs/226.wav|the spread of mohammedanism caused new cities to be built, and babylon was the quarry for their building material. 
./ljs/wavs/227.wav|rifle among oswald's possessions 
./ljs/wavs/228.wav|has never been surpassed. 
./ljs/wavs/229.wav|where he waited till four p.m., the time at which the queen and prince consort usually took an afternoon drive. 
./ljs/wavs/230.wav|and to them came hope of returning to jerusalem. 
./ljs/wavs/231.wav|a short time later misess paine told her that someone had shot the president, quote, from the building in which lee is working, end quote. 
./ljs/wavs/232.wav|plainly pointing to the perpetration of other crimes. 
./ljs/wavs/233.wav|nevertheless, she attempted to commit suicide by driving her nails, purposely left long, into her throat. 
./ljs/wavs/234.wav|the stairs from one floor to the next are "l shaped," with both legs of the "l" approximately the same length. 
./ljs/wavs/235.wav|in the territory of the secret service regional office which includes dallas and fort worth. 
./ljs/wavs/236.wav|after he returned to the united states 
./ljs/wavs/237.wav|chief rowley testified that agents on duty in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief, 
./ljs/wavs/238.wav|he thought it contained tent poles, or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel. 
./ljs/wavs/239.wav|the man, bousfield, however, whose execution was so sadly bungled, 
./ljs/wavs/240.wav|he may have erred in some points through ignorance, but in others he was clearly guilty of culpable neglect. 
./ljs/wavs/241.wav|after the president had retired at his hotel, 
./ljs/wavs/242.wav|in this way, it learned that when oswald had arrived in the soviet union 
./ljs/wavs/243.wav|misess evelyn d siegel, a social worker who interviewed both lee and his mother while lee was confined in youth house, 
./ljs/wavs/244.wav|the other brother was accordingly sent on a pretended mission to shrigley to bring mister turner on to london, whither wakefield and miss turner also proceeded. 
./ljs/wavs/245.wav|according to the testimony of frazier, marina oswald, and ruth paine, it appears that oswald never returned to irving in midweek 
./ljs/wavs/246.wav|the iron knell that rang upon the beating heart of the living man who was about to die; 
./ljs/wavs/247.wav|at the southeast corner of tenth street and patton avenue, moments before the tippit shooting. 
./ljs/wavs/248.wav|our interest in this man at this point, was to determine whether his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of the country. 
./ljs/wavs/249.wav|during entire periods of travel status, 
./ljs/wavs/250.wav|and "to dispose him, by meditation and seclusion, to return to an honest life." 
./ljs/wavs/251.wav|the leaders of the five families in new york, as well as al capone from chicago and magaddino from buffalo, were appointed to the new board, 
./ljs/wavs/252.wav|on the morning of october twenty-fifth, nineteen fifty-seven, anastasia entered the barber shop of the park sheraton hotel, 
./ljs/wavs/253.wav|at fifty-sixth street and seventh avenue in midtown manhattan. 
./ljs/wavs/254.wav|as anastasia relaxed in the barber's chair, two men with scarves covering their faces rushed in, 
./ljs/wavs/255.wav|shoved the barber out of the way, then shot and killed anastasia. 
./ljs/wavs/256.wav|with frank costello, who months earlier avoided a similar fate after being shot and wounded 
./ljs/wavs/257.wav|as he walked out of his new york apartment. 
./ljs/wavs/258.wav|angelo ruggiero, a riveting puzzle etched into the chronicles of organized crime, 
./ljs/wavs/259.wav|wielded a mesmerizing blend of intellectual prowess and unswerving loyalty, 
./ljs/wavs/260.wav|like a suspenseful narrative. a puppeteer of power,
./ljs/wavs/261.wav|legacy emerged from the crucible of the mid twentieth century, 
./ljs/wavs/262.wav|he deftly navigated the treacherous waters of criminal enterprise, earning the moniker, the teflon don 
./ljs/wavs/263.wav|a man whose influence left an indelible mark on the south african republic
./ljs/wavs/264.wav|his earnings were a mere twenty dollars for all the hard, he earned just a little
./ljs/wavs/265.wav|after hanging about the folkestone office for some time, they saw at last that the key was kept in a certain cupboard. 
./ljs/wavs/266.wav|still watching and waiting for the first chance, they seized it when the clerks left the office empty for a moment. 
./ljs/wavs/267.wav|pierce boldly stepped in, found the cupboard unlocked; he removed the key, handed it to agar outside, 
./ljs/wavs/268.wav|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to pierce; pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done. 
./ljs/wavs/269.wav|after this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery.
